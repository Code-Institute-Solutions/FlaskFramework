        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
		recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
		Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
		Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
		Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
		action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
		leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
			<p>
				In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely Mountain.
				Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
				2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the
				Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some
				point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained
				the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

            <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
			<p>
				Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews of
				Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
				the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            <h3>Óin</h3>
			<p>
				Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. He usually wore a brown-hooded
				cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined
				with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves
				who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually
				in charge of preparing the fire for the Company. He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later
				settled in the Lonely Mountain along with many other of the Dwarves of The Company of Thorin such as Bombur.

				In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves
				and Orcs. In TA 2941, Glóin and his brother Óin, along with his cousins Dwalin and Balin, were among the Dwarves
				accompanying Thorin and Company during their quest to the Lonely Mountain to recapture it from the Dragon Smaug. He
				was noted for his skills with a tinderbox, and, along with his brother Óin, was usually the one told to get a fire
				started whenever the Dwarves made camp. Gloin also fought in the Battle of the Five Armies. After the battle, he
				settled in the Lonely Mountain.

            <h3>Balin</h3>
			<p>
				Balin was a Dwarf, son of Fundin, and likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of Smaug the Dragon. He
				had a younger brother named Dwalin and was one of those driven from their homes when the dragon Smaug attacked the
				Lonely Mountain. Afterwards he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee. He fought in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs.
				Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go
				back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

				Bofur was a descendant(related) of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, but was not of Durin's Folk. He and his family hailed
				from the Blue Mountains. As such, they felt less strongly about the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the
				dragon Smaug, more interested in the adventure than a home they'd never seen.

            <h3>Bombur</h3>
			<p>
				Bombur's parentage is unknown; the only familial connections mentioned are his brother Bofur and his cousin Bifur.
				Bombur was not of Durin's line although he was descended from dwarves of Moria. His birth year is also unknown.
				However, from Bilbo Baggins' account from the quest to Erebor it is known that the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the
				youngest of the 13 "by some fifty years" and that after Thorin had been captured, Balin was "the eldest left". Since
				Fíli was born in T.A. 2859 and Balin was born in 2763, this would put Bombur's birth between 2763 and 2809, and he
				would have been between 132 and 178 years old during the quest to Erebor. Prior to the quest Bombur probably lived
				in the Blue Mountains with Thorin after the loss of Thráin The II.

			<p>
				Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar. He was a Maia of Manwë and Varda. He also
				served under two other Valar, such as Irmo and Nienna. When the Valar decided to send the order of the Istari (also
				known as Wizards) to Middle-earth, to counsel and assist all those in Middle-earth who opposed the Dark Lord Sauron,
				Manwë and Varda decided to include Olórin among the five who were sent.
