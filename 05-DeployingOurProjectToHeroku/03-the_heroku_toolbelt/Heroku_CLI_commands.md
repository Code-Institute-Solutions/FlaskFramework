### To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In your IDE, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.


### Rename a Heroku App:
- `heroku apps:rename NEW-NAME --app CURRENT-APP-NAME`


### Deployed Heroku App URL:
- `https://YOUR-APP-NAME.herokuapp.com`
